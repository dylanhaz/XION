XION is my re-envisioned version of the game I once made back in 2009 originally using the GameMaker language. I lost the game due to a hard drive failure. I am now remaking a new version of it with ES6 and the Phaser3 Game Framework.

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm start` | Build project and open web server running project |
| `npm run build` | Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..) |
